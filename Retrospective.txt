Web-Server - What i have learned (Retrospective)

Packages used:
[1] express
    -description
        used to create a webserver to host static content or send JSON objects, 
        express is a function so when initialising = const app = express(), then use app.get/set/listen/static etc
    - example
        main methods = get, set, use, listen

[2] path
    -description
        used to find relative path for public files such as css/js/imgs
    -example
        const dirPath = path.join(__dirname, '../public')
        __dirname = gets directory to the app.js file where its called which gives you webserver folder
        '../public' = gets you to the folder based from __dirname

[3] handlebars (hbs)
    -description
        used in conjunction with express to give out dynamic static html, e.g.
    - example 
        hbs file
        <h1>{{name}}</h1>

        express file
        app.send('/me', (req,res)=>{
            res.render({
                name: "Joe"
            })
        })
